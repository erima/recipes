Prep Time: 

===================================================================
Ingredients

4 cups vegetable broth
2 cups water
1 teaspoon salt, to taste
2  cups polenta
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup Asiago cheese, or blend
  
4 cups mushrooms, sliced
14 oz. artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt, to taste
pepper, to taste
1/3 cup pasta sauce, optional
===================================================================
Directions

Bring broth and water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the salt when boiling. Sprinkle polenta into boiling liquid with one hand while stirring with a wooden spoon using the other hand. Reduce heat to simmer and continue to stir, frequently at first and then constantly to prevent sticking. The liquid should be completely absorbed. Continue to stir constantly until the liquid in the mixture evaporates even more. The whole process takes 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in the butter and cheese.

Spoon mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish that has been coated with olive oil spray. Let this rest for 10 to 15 minutes to firm up while preparing mushrooms and artichoke hearts.

Sauté mushrooms and artichoke hearts over medium-high heat in olive oil with salt and pepper for 10 minutes or until mushrooms have given up their liquid. Stir in the pasta sauce if using.

To serve, cut the polenta into square "cakes" and top with mushroom mixture. Garnish with additional cheese or a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if desired.

Notes

"Native to northern Italy, this captivating and versatile entrée looks as good as it tastes. Hearty wild mushrooms and delicate artichoke hearts combine with savory Asiago cheese in this classic polenta dish. Makes a complete vegetarian meal when served with steamed beets and dark leafy greens."
