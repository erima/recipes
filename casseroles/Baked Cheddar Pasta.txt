Prep Time:

Ingredients:
12 ounces dry gluten-free penne, spirals or macaroni pasta
1 1/2 tablespoons light olive oil, (or butter)
2 tablespoons sweet rice flour, (or all-purpose gluten-free flour mix)
2 1/2 cups milk, (or non-dairy unsweetened milk substitute)
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, (or non-dairy gluten-free cheese)
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon gluten-free honey mustard
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
2 tablespoons dry sherry, or white wine- optional
1 cup Gluten-Free "Bread" Crumbs - for topping
1/4 teaspoon teaspoon paprika, up to 1/2 tsp.

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil and cook the gluten-free pasta just until it is al dente - tender, but still quite firm to the bite. Drain the pasta in a colander and rinse it quickly under cold water. Set aside.

In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat, and stir in the rice flour (I like to use a whisk to do this). Cook and stir the flour for about 10 seconds, then slowly add in the milk, whisking to blend the flour paste and milk (called a roux).

Bring the mixture to a boil (it will thicken as it heats) then reduce the heat to low. Add the shredded cheddar, salt and pepper, mustard and nutmeg and stir. If adding a dash of sherry, add it now.

Continue stirring the sauce until the cheddar melts, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a 6-cup baking dish, combine the cooked penne with the cheddar sauce. Sprinkle the top of the casserole with buttered gluten-free bread crumbs and paprika.

Bake at 350 degrees F for about 25 minutes, until bubbling.
