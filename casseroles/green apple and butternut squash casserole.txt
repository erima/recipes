Ingredients

Olive oil spray
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 cups mushrooms, quartered
1 small butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 small yellow onion, chopped
Salt and pepper
1/2 cup bread crumbs
2 granny smith apples, peeled, cored, and roughly chopped
1 teaspoon chopped thyme, (optional)
1/2 cup toasted chopped pecans, (optional)

===================================================================
Directions

Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Spray a medium baking dish with olive oil cooking spray and set aside. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add mushrooms, celery, squash, onions and salt and cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes. Reduce heat, cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until squash is just tender. 

Meanwhile, melt remaining two tablespoons butter in a small pot. Add breadcrumbs, stir to coat and set aside. Add apples, thyme, salt and pepper to squash mixture and cook until apples are tender, 5 to 10 minutes more. Transfer squash mixture and any pan juices to reserved dish and sprinkle bread crumbs over the top. Bake until bread crumbs are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. For extra crunch, garnish with toasted pecans before serving.

Notes

"A delicious and unexpected combination of flavors, this easy to prepare casserole is one of our seasonal favorites. The toasted pecan and bread crumb topping adds a bit of crunch to the velvety soft texture of baked apples and butternut squash."
