Roman Pizza Dough
===================================================================

Servings/Yield: 6 dough balls
Prep Time: 

===================================================================
Ingredients

5 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, (22 1/2 ounces)
1/4 cup semonlina flour, (1 ounce)
1 3/4 teaspoons table salt, (or 3 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt)
1 teaspoon instant yeast
1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons water, (65°)

===================================================================
Directions

1. With a large metal spoon, stir together all the ingredients in a four quart bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer until combined. 

IF MIXING WITH AN ELECTRIC MIXER
fit it with the dough hook and mix on low speed for about four minutes, or until all the flour gathers to form a course ball. Let the dough rest for five minute, then mix again on medium–low speed for an additional two minutes, or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl and sticks just a little to the bottom. If the dough is too soft and sticky to hold its shape, mix in more flour by the tablespoonful; if it is too stiff or dry mix in more water by the tablespoonful. The dough should pass the windowpane test (in book, pg 105)

IF MIXING BY HAND
Repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon into room–temperature water and use it much like a dough hook, working the dough vigorously into a coarse ball as you rotate the bowl with your other hand. As all the flour is incorporated into the ball, about four minutes, the dough will begin to strengthen; when this occurs, let the dough rest for five minutes and then resume mixing for an additional two to three minutes, or until the dough is tack, soft, and supple. If the dough is too soft and sticky to hold its shape, mix in more flour by the tablespoonful; if it is too stiff or dry, mix in more water by the tablespoonful. The dough should pass the windowpane test (in book, pg 105).

2. Transfer the dough to a floured counter, dust the top of the dough with flour to absorb the surface moisture, and then, working from the four corners, fold the dough into a ball. Place the ball in a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil, turn the dough to coat it with the oil, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough sit at room temperature for thirty minutes, then put the bowl in the refrigerator overnight. (Or, if you are making the pizzas on the same day, let the dough sit at room temperature for one and a half hours, punch it down, reshape it into a ball, return the ball to the bowl, and then cover and refrigerate for at least two hours.)

3. The next day (or later the same day if refrigerated for only two hours), remove the bowl of dough from the refrigerator two hours before you plan to make the pizzas. The dough will have expanded somewhat and the gluten will be very relaxed. Using a plastic bowl scraper dipped in water, or using wet hands, gently transfer the dough to a floured counter, trying to degas the dough as little as possible. Using a pastry blade that has been dipped in water, divide it into six equal pieces. Gently round each piece into a ball and brush or rub each ball with olive oil. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment or a nonstick silicone baking liner and brush with olive oil. Place each dough ball on the plan and loosely cover the pan with either plastic wrap or a food–grade plastic bag. (If you do not plan to use all the pieces, place the extra ones in individual zippered freezer bags and refrigerate or freeze). Use the refrigerated balls within two days and the frozen balls within three months.) Allow the dough balls to sit at room temperature for two hours before making the pizzas.SOURCE: Peter Reinhart
