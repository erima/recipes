Servings/Yield: Makes 16 to 17 ounces (enough for 1 batch of French Bread, page 168; Pain de Campagne, page 195; or Pane Siciliano, page 198)
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	1 1/8 cups (5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
	1 1/8 cups (5 ounces) unbleached bread flour
	3/4 teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt
	1/2 teaspoon (.055 ounce) instant yeast
	3/4 cup to 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (6 to 7 ounces) water, at room temperature
	
Directions: 
	1. Stir together the flours, salt, and yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add 3/4 cup of the water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (or mix on low speed for 1 minute with the paddle attachment). Adjust the flour or water according to nee, so that the dough is neither too sticky nor too stiff. (It is better to err on the sticky side, as you can adjust easier during kneading. It is harder to add water once the dough firms up.)
	
	2. Sprinkle some flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the conter. Knead for 4 to 6 minutes (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook for 4 minutes), or until the dough is soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky. The internal temperature should be between 77ºF to 81ºF.
	
	3. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 1 hour, or until it swells to about 1 1/2 times its original size.
	
	4. Remove the dough from the bowl, knead it lightly to degas, and return it to the bowl, covering the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight. You can keep this in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze it in an airtight plastic bag for up to 3 months.
