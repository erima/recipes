Bread Profile: Enriched, standard dough; direct or indirect method; commercial yeast
Servings/Yield: Makes two 1–pound loaves, 18 dinner rolls, or 12 burger or hot dog buns.
Prep Time: 1 Day
	Day 1: 8 to 10 minutes mixing; 3 1/2 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 15 to 45 minutes baking
	
Ingredients: 
4 3/4 cups (21.5 ounces) unbleached bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoons (.38 ounces) salt
1/4 cup (1.33 ounces) powdered milk (DMS)
3 1/4 tablespoons (1.66 ounces) sugar
2 teaspoons (.22 ounces) instant yeast
1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, slightly beaten, at room temperature
3 1/4 tablespoons (1.66 ounces) butter, margarine, or shortening, melted or at room temperature
1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon to 1 3/4 cups (13 to 14 ounces) water, at room temperature
1 egg, whisked with 1 teaspoon water until frothy, for egg wash (optional)
Sesame or poppy seeds for garnish (optional)


Directions: 
	1. Mix together the flour, salt, powdered milk, sugar, and yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bol of an electric mixer). Pour in the egg, butter, and 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon water and mix with a large metal spoon (or on low speed of the electric mixer with the paddle attachment) until all the flour is absorbed and the dough forms a ball. If the dough seems very stiff and dry, trickle in more water until the dough is soft and supple.
	
	2. Sprinkle flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with a dough hook), adding more flour, if necessary, to create a dough that is soft, supple, and tacky but not sticky. Continue kneading (or mixing) for 6 to 8 minutes. (In the electric mixer, the dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick ever so slightly to the bottom.) The dough should pass the windowpane test (page 58) and register 80ºF. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
	
	3. Ferment at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size (the length of time will depend on the room temperature).
	
	4. Remove the fermented dough from the bowl and divide it in half for sandwich loaves, into eighteen 2-ounce pieces for dinner rolls, or twelve 3-ounce pieces for burger or hot dog buns.Shape the pieces into boules (page 72) for loaves or tight rounds (page 82) for dinner rolls or buns. Mist the dough lightly with spray oil and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rest for about 20 minutes.
	
	5. For loaves, shape as shown on page 81. Lightly oil two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch loaf pans and place the loaves in the pans. For rolls and buns, line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment. Rolls require no further shaping. For hamburger buns, gently press down on the rolls to form the desired shape. For hot dog buns, shape as shown on page 80, though without tapering the ends. Transfer the rolls or buns to the sheet pans.
	
	6. Mist the tops of the dough with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic or a towel. Proof the dough at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes, or until it nearly doubles in size.
	
	7. Preheat the oven to 350ºF for loaves or 400º for roll and buns. Brush the rolls or buns with the egg wash and garnish with poppy or sesame seeds. Sandwich loaves also may be washed and garnished, or score them down the center and rub a little vegetable oil in the slit.
	
	8. Bake the rolls or buns for approximately 15 minutes, or until they are golden brown and register just above 180ºF in the center. Bake loaves for 35 to 45 minutes, rotating 180 degrees halfway through for even baking, if needed. The tops should be golden brown and the sides, when removed from the pan, should also be golden. The internal temperature of the loaves should be close to 190ºF, and the loaves should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.
	
	9. When the loaves have finished baking, removed them immediately from the pans and cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving. Rolls should cool for at least 15 minutes on a rack before serving.
