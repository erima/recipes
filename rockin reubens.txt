Ingredients

- 8 ounces tempeh, Cut in 1/8-inch-thick slices
- 1 cup sauerkraut
- 1/4  cup soy mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 2 tablespoons relish
- (null) salt
- ground pepper
- (null) butter or margarine
- 8  slices pumpernickel bread
- 4 slices cheese


=======================
Directions

Poach the tempeh in a saucepan of simmering water for eight minutes. Drain the water from the saucepan and add the sauerkraut. Cover and cook over low heat for five minutes. Remove the tempeh and sauerkraut from the saucepan and set aside to cool. 

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the soy mayonnaise, ketchup, and pickle relish. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Blend well and set aside. 

Spread the butter onto one side of each slice of bread. Spread the mayonnaise mixture on the remaining side of each slide of bread and place two of the bread slices, butter side down, in a large skillet. 

Arrange one-quarter of the tempeh and sauerkraut on the bread in the skillet and top each with a slice of cheese and another slice of prepared bread, margarine side up. 

Cook the sandwiches in the skillet, turning once, until browned on both sides, about three minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make two more sandwiches.
