FAUX CHICKEN FLAVOURING

Source: La Dolce Vegan!
Servings/Yield: 2 large or 4 small servings
Prep Time: 5 minutes prep & 60 minutes simmer, and maybe 30 minutes baking (your choice)

Ingredients: 
	Basic Instant Gluten (see recipe above)
	
	Broth:
		2 cups water
		1/4 cup nutritional yeast
		2 tbsp tamari
		1 tsp onion powder
		1 tsp dried sage
		1/2 tsp dried thyme
		1/2 tsp salt
		1/4 tsp celery seed

Directions: 

	In a large saucepan, bring all of the broth ingredients to a boil. Slice Basic Instant Gluten into steaks, chunks or strips and drop carefully into broth. Reduce heat and cover with lid. Let simmer for 50-60 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until broth has reduced completely. 

	Use "chicken" immediately in your dish of choice or store in the refrigerator (for up to 6 days) or the freezer (for up to 6 months). For a chewier texture, once you've boiled the "chicken", bake it at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a lightly oiled baking dish for 30 minutes. 

Notes: 
	When making 2x, 3x, 4x batches remember it takes that it also multiplies the cooking time thusly.
