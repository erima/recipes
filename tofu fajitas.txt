Ingredients

1 lb. extra-firm tofu
1/2 whole lime, juiced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
0 to taste salt
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 large red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 green bell pepper, cored, seeded and sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and sliced
1 tablespoon canola oil, or peanut oil
4 tortillas, wheat spelt or corn tortillas, warmed
1 avocado, peeled and diced
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
Salsa

=====================
Directions

Firmly press tofu between layers of paper towels to remove as much liquid as possible, then cut into 2-inch x 1/2-inch strips and transfer to a wide, shallow dish. Mix lime juice, cumin, salt and cayenne in a small bowl and pour half of the mixture over the tofu. Toss gently to coat all over, cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes, or overnight. Put onions, peppers and remaining lime juice mixture into a large bowl, toss well, cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes, or overnight. 

Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add tofu and stir-fry until browned on all sides; transfer to a plate. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to skillet, add peppers and onions and stir-fry over high heat until browned and fragrant. Add tofu back to the skillet and mix to combine it with the peppers and onions. 

Assemble tacos by filling each warm tortilla with the tofu mixture, avocados, cilantro and salsa. Serve immediately.
