Servings/Yield:  15 – 20 bars
Prep Time: 40 minutes

Ingredients: 
	1 ½ cups sesame seeds
	¾ cup almond meal
	½ cup flax seed (golden flax is preferred)
	½ cup macadamia nuts (finely chopped)
	¼ cup cashews (finely chopped)	
	½ cup brown rice syrup (or corn syrup)
	2 tablespoons evaporated cane syrup (or corn syrup)
	2 teaspoons cinnamon
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	½ teaspoon salt

Directions: 
Mix all ingredients together in a bowl and press into a well oiled 9 X 13 pan (I use olive oil spray).

Bake for 20 minutes at 300 degrees.

Cut in to bars while hot (it's so much easier than trying to cut when cool!).
