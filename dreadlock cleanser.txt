big bowl of warm water, or hot-ish if you can stand it.
3/4 cup of baking soda
8-9 drops of tea tree oil
2 tablespoons of lemon juice
2 tablespoons of sea salt


Stir until it is disolved. Soak dreads in the bowl or use a sqirt bottle or something similar to apply it to your scalp and dreads.

Grab a towel and wrap it aroud your head and leave it there for around half an hour, or more.

Rinse it out, well.
