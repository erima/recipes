1. Use one teaspoon of tea leaves per cup. If brewing a pot of tea, throw in an extra teaspoon for the pot.

2. Warm your empty teapot or cup by rinsing it with boiling water. Discard this water.

3. Bring fresh, cold water to a rolling boil. Pour boiling water over tea. For green and white teas use slightly cooler water (170 - 180 F).

4. Steeping times are crucial as a properly brewed tea can not be judged by color alone. Steep all green teas for 3 minutes, black teas for 3-5 minutes, and oolong teas for 5-7 minutes. Herbal infusions steep to desired strength.

5. Using an infusing device or strainer, separate the leaves from the water.

6. Sip slowly and enjoy!
