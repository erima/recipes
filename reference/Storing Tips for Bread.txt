DO
	* Lean, crusty breads are stored differently than soft, enriched breads. If you want to preserve the crustiness in lean breads, store them in paper, but they will become stale within a day and are best eaten on the same day they are made. If you want to preserve them for more than a day, "cater wrap" the loaves in plastic wrap (this means wrap them completely in both directions to prevent any air from getting to them). Then, either freeze or place them in a cool, dark place. You can also use zipper–style plastic bags, squeezing out all the air before sealing. When freezing, it is acceptable to preslice the loaf so that you can remove only what you need without defrosting the entire loaf. Snack–sized zippered bags are useful for individual slices.
	
	* Soft, enriched bread, such as sandwich bread, is always best stored in plastic and either frozen or kept in a cool, dark place (exposure to sunlight causes the loaf to sweat, creating condensation in the wrapper and, eventually mold on the loaf). Presliced sandwich loaves are best for freezing, allowing for removal of only the slices you are planning to use (and they thaw much more quickly than whole loaves).
	
	* If you have a frozen unsliced loaf and watn to thaw it, pull it from the freezer at least 2 hours before you need to use it. Do not try to accelerate the thawing by putting it into the oven or microwave. This will only dry it out. Of course, in an emergency, when you have to get bread on the table and have forgotten to thaw it in advance, you can quickly thaw it in the microwave or in a hot oven. The bst way to prevent it from drying out is to place it under a wet towel. Heat the oven to 400ºF, place the bread in a pan, and cover teh pan with a towel that has been soaked in warm water and then wrung out. Check on the towel every 10 minutes to see if it needs rewetting. It should take 20 to 30 minutes to thaw out a standard–sized loaf, 10 to 20 minutes for a baguette. If you want to restore a crackly crust to the bread, remove the towel for the final few minutes and turn the oven up to 450ºF.
	
DON’T
	* Don’t store bread in the refrigerator. It dries out, even when packaged in sealed plastic bags.
	* Don’t store crusty breads in plastic bags or in plastic wrap unless you plan to recrisp the crust in the oven.
	* Don’t store soft, enriched breads in paper bags unless you intend to dry them out for bread crumbs or croutons.
	* Don’t store any bread that you intend to dry for crumbs in plastic bags or plastic wrap. If the moisture cannot escape, the bread will eventually mold.
	*  Don’t store warm bread in plastic bags or plastic wrap. Wait until it has completely cooled down (no warmth at all), to prevent condensation from forming in the bag and thus accelerating mold development.
