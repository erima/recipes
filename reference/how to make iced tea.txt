1. Use twice the tea (or half the water) and twice the steeping time as normal and follow the instructions above for preparing hot tea.

2. After removing the tea leaves from the brewed tea; cool the tea until it is only slightly warm.

3. Fill a tall glass with ice. Pour the warm tea over the ice. This will yield a glass of iced tea 1/2 full of ice–the perfect ratio.

4. Enjoy with a wedge of lemon, some sugar or just plain!
