How to tell when bread is done:
	* Hard, crusty bread is baked until the center of the loaf registers 200ºF to 210ºF (I shoot for 205ºF in most instances). Of course, if the outside is changing from golden brown to black, that is from caramel to carbon, you might have to pull the brad out before it reaches that internal temperature. Or, you can make a tent of aluminum foil or even of baking parchment and cover the bread with it to buy a few more minutes of baking time. The whole point of intense baking is to drive off excess moisture in order to concentrate on the flavors. Also the higher heat ensures full gelatinization of the starches, thus evoking more flavor from the grain.
	
	* Soft bread, such as enriched dinner rolls and sandwich bread, needs to exceet at least 180ºF in the center. Small items like rolls wil lusually set as soon as they pass 180ºF, but I prefer to wait until the dough registers 185ºF to 190ºF for full size loaves to be sure there are no underbaked doughy sections. Also, thump on the bottom of the loaves and listen for a hollow reverberation rather than a dull quietness. The sides should be firm rather than soft and crushable, golden with caramelization rather than white or uncolored.
	
	* Alaways test the internal temperature by probing to the center of the center. By this I mean place the thermometer through the center of the bottom or the top of the loaf and go to the center of the dough. This will be the last place to receive the heat and will thus be the coolest section. If it registers the temperature you seek, then the rest of the loaf will also be at least that hot.
	
	* Cooling is an important part of baking.
