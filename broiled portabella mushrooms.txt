Servings/Yield: 2
Prep Time: 40 minutes (preheat)

Ingredients:
	1 pound portabella mushrooms
	1 tablespoon light miso
	1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
	2 tablespoons water
	2 teaspoons olive oil
	10 ounces fresh spinach, stemmed and rinsed

Directions:
	Preheat the broiler.
	
	Carefully brush or wipe off any soil from the mushrooms. Trim the tough portions of the stems and cut the mushrooms into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Whisk together the miso, vinegar, water, and oil. Brush the mushroom slices with the marinade and place them on a baking sheet. Broil about 3 inches from the heat for about 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are browned and beginning to soften.
	
	Meanwhile, steam the spinach in a covered pot on high heat, using only the water clinging to its leaves, for 1 or 2 minutes, or until just wilted but still bright green.
	Spread the steamed spinach on a serving platter, arrange the broiled mushrooms on top, and serve right away.
