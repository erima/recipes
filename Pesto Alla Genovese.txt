Ingredients

2 cups basil leaves, fresh
8 cloves garlic, minced

3/4 cup parmigiano-reggiano cheese
1/4 teaspoons black pepper

Directions

1. In a blender or food processor, combine the basil, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice and purée until smooth. Add half the pine nuts and blend for a few seconds to grind them coarsely.

Notes

This recipe makes a smooth, creamy pesto. It can be baked on top of focaccia or pizza, or drizzled over it after it comes out of the oven. It will keep for about a week in the refrigerator, but will be at its best during the first 24 hours. It begins to lose some of its bright color and flavor the longer it sits. You can substitute toasted walnuts for the pine nuts, or add them in equal parts.

PESTO VARIATIONS

Parsley Pesto: Substitute an equal amount of flat–leaf parsley for the basil, or use parsley and basil in any combination equaling two cups.

Spinach Pesto: Increase the olive oil to 1 1/4 cups and add 1 cup thawed, frozen chopped spinach, well drained, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the blender or processor with the other ingredients. Proceed as directed. This makes a beautiful bright green pesto.

Roasted Pepper Pesto: Substitute an equal amount of roasted red peppers for the basil, or use basil and roasted peppers in any combination equaling two cups. The pepper provide a rich, earthy flavor.

Sun–Dried Tomato Pesto: Add 5 olive oil–packed sun–dried tomatoes, drained and chopped, to the blender or processor with the other ingredients. Proceed as directed. The sun–dried tomatoes give the pesto a greater complexity. I prefer to use sun–dried tomatoes in tandem with other ingredients or small doses, as they have a particularly intense flavor. For a milder option, use oven–roasted tomatoes. You can purchase them at gourmet delicatessens, or you can roast them at home by brushing tomato slices with Herb Oil (page 147) and then roasting them in at 400ºF oven for about 20 minutes, or until they begin to bubble and lightly char on top.

* substitute Parmigiano-Reggiano with pecorino Romano
