Servings/Yield: 4
Prep Time:  20 minutes

Ingredients: 
	8 cups water
	1 bunch watercress, chopped
	1/4 cup scallion, minced
	3 tablespoon tamari
	4 ounces soba noodles
	6 tablespoons white miso paste

Directions: 
	Bring the water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Add the watercress, scallions and tamari. Add the noodles, decrease the heat to medium, and simmer until the noodles are tender, about 5 minutes. Decrease the heat to low.
	
	Place about 1/4 cup of the hot soup mixture in a small bowl and add the miso paste, blending well. Stir the blended miso mixture back into the soup and simmer for 2 minutes being careful not to boil. Serve hot.

Notes: 
	I've tweaked it a bit from the original recipe… there was too much watercress in it and not enough broth. Adding baked tofu was really the best evar… but it makes it take much longer.
	
	Substitute 3/4 cups rice (1 1/2 cups water) for noodles.
