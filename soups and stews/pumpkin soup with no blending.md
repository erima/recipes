* Prep Time: 60 minutes

## Ingredients:

* 1 medium sweet yellow onion
* 1 tablespoon butter or olive oil
* 29 ounces of packed pumpkin One can is 29 ounces , or two 15 ounce cans
* 6 cups of chicken stock or vegetable stock we prefer homemade stock to reduce sodium but the box stuff works too
* 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 1 tablespoon real maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice homemade pumpkin pie spice
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch we use non-GMO organic cornstarch
* 1/4 cup water
* sour cream optional
* chopped parsley optional

## Directions:

Chop onion into 1/4 inch pieces and saute on high in a small amount of butter until very soft and just starting to turn golden.

Add pumpkin, stock, salt, pepper, maple syrup, and pumpkin pie spice. Mix well.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low. Leave uncovered and relax for 50 minutes while you pretend you're still cooking. (Or cook for 15 minutes if you're really short on time)

After soup has simmered, combine water and cornstarch until thoroughly mixed.

Increase heat and add cornstarch slurry to soup. Boil until thickened (a couple of minutes) and then remove from heat.

To serve, ladle into bowls and top with a dollop of sour cream and chopped parlsey if desired.

To freeze, let cool enough to ladle into zip top bags and freeze flat. Thaw the soup enough to remove from bag, then heat on the stove before serving.
