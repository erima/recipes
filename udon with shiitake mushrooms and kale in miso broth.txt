Servings/Yield:  4
Prep Time:  35 minutes

Ingredients: 
	1/2 pound fresh udon noodles or dried udon noodles
	2 tablespoons vegetable oil
	1 medium size red onion, sliced into thin half-moons
	4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems trimmed, sliced
	3 cloves garlic, minced
	2 teaspoons ginger, minced
	2 cups water
	3 tablespoons miso (more if light)
	4 cups chopped kale
	2 teaspoons soy sauce, or to taste
	
Directions: 
	Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the udon according to the package directions, about 10 minutes. When done, drain and rinse with cool water until ready to use.
	
	Meanwhile, preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onion and mushrooms in the oil for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and the onions are softened but still have some crunch. Add the garlic and ginger, and sauté for another minute. Add the mirin, water, and miso, and bring to a gentle boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and add the kale. Toss the mixture around with tongs until the kale has wilted. Add the noodles and use a pasta spoon to stir them into the broth for about 2 minutes. 
	
	Divide the udon and vegetables among bowls and spoon some broth over each serving.
