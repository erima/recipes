Prep Time:  60 minutes

Ingredients: 
	TOFU
		1 pound extra firm tofu
   		soy sauce
   
	SALAD
		3 ribs celery, diced
		1 red onion, diced
		1 red bell pepper, diced
		.5 teaspoon basil
		.5 teaspoon sage
		.5 teaspoon rosemary
		.5 teaspoon oregano
		2 teaspoons paprika
		1.5 cups mayonaise

Directions: 
	BAKED TOFU
		Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly oil or spray a baking sheet.
		
		Slice tofu 1/4-inch thick. Brush each slice, back and front, with soy sauce and allow it to marinate for 10 minutes. 
		
		Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake for 30-35 minutes, turning once halfway through, until a deep, golden brown and crispy on the outside but still tender on the inside. Remove from oven and allow to cool until you can handle the slices. 
		
	SALAD PREPARATION
		Shred the tofu slices with a sharp knife, creating irregular, angular pieces â€¦reminiscent of shredded chicken. Mix with vegetables, spices and Tofu Mayo until ingredients are well-incorporated. 
		
		Chill thoroughly before serving.
