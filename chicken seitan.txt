Servings/Yield: 4
Prep Time: 15 mins prep, 45 mins total.

Ingredients: 
	2 1/4 cups vital wheat gluten
	1/2 teaspoon baking powder
	3 teaspoons reduced sodium soy sauce
	1 cup cold water
	2 vegetarian chicken bouillon cubes
	1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
	
	
Directions: 
	Combine soy sauce and seasonings with cold water. Mix vital wheat gluten with baking powder then add liquid to it all at once. Knead very well on a lightly floured surface. Dough will be difficult to work with, this is normal. Knead about 30 times. 
	
	Cover with a towel or bowl and let sit for 15 minutes. Meanwhile bring about 10 cups of water to a simmer. 
	
	Divide the gluten dough into pieces of desired shape and size. Put into simmering water and gently simmer for 30 minutes. 
	
	Allow to cool in the water. Drain and use as desired just as you would real meat. Seitan may be frozen for later use in recipes.
	
Notes: 
	Might be necessary to cook longer if pieces are too big.
	
	Alissa didn’t like this but I’m pretty sure I didn’ty make it right.
