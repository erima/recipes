Filled Noodle Nests 

Source: Cooking with Seitan
Servings/Yield: 6 servings
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	2 cups (~1lb) seitan strips (2 x 1/2 x 1/8 inches)
	2 1/2 tablespoons arrowroot
	1/4 cup water for dissolving arrowroot
	2 tablespoons soy sauce
	1 tablespoon mirin
	1 teaspoon fresh ginger root, grated
	1 tablespoon sesame oil
	1/2 pound snow peas, trimmed and destringed
	1 can (8 oz) sliced water chestnuts
	1 1/2 cups stock or water

	NOODLE NESTS
		8 ounces whole wheat spaghetti or linguini, cooked al dente and chilled
		Oil for deep-frying

Directions: 
	To prepare noodle nests, heat 3 inches of oil a 3 or 4 quart saucepan. Immerse 1/2 cup of noodles (be sure they are chilled and dry) in the hot oil, and keep them submerged with chopsticks or tongs. Hold the noodles against the sides of the pot to form the shape of a nest. After about a minute, the shape should be set. Release the noodles, turn the nest over, and cook until crispy and codlin. Place on absorbent paper towels to remove any excess oil.

	To prepare the filling, first dissolve the arrowroot in 1/4 cup of water. Add the soy sauce, mirin, and ginger, and set aside.

	Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add the seitan strips and quickly stir–fry them until browned and crispy (5 – 7 minutes). Add the snow peas and water chestnuts, and continue to stir–fry over high heat. When the vegetables are thoroughly heated, add the stock and arrowroot mixture. Heat and stir until the sauce is translucent.

	Arrange the noodle nests on a platter or individual plates and fill with the seitan–vegetable sauce.
