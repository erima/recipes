Prep Time: 

===================================================================
Ingredients

3 packages Udon noodles
1 package tofu, cubed
1/3 cup sesame seeds
2 tablespoons cornstarch
0 tablespoon oil, for frying
1 small red pepper, thinly sliced
1 small orange pepper, thinly sliced
1 inch ginger root, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
4 whole green onions, thinly sliced

===================================================================
Directions

1. Cook noodles according to the directions on the package.

2. Place tofu in a bowl and add sesame seeds. Toss until most of the seeds are stuck on the tofu (you don't need full coverage here). Add cornstarch and gently toss until tofu is coated. If you still have some seeds in the bottom of the bowl, dump the tofu out on a cookie sheet and roll the cubes in the excess seeds.

3. Fry tofu in some oil over medium heat until nicely golden. Turn regularly to brown all sides. You don't need a lot of oil here. Start with a relatively thin layer and add more as needed. Remove tofu from pan/wok and drain.

4. Add peppers, ginger and garlic to the pan (there should be just a bit of oil left) and stir fry for 3-4 mins, until softened and fragrant. Add noodles to the pan/wok and fry for a min.

5. Add vinegar, soy sauce, and hoisin sauce and mix well. Add tofu and mix well. Cook until sauce thickens/soaks into the noodles. Adjust flavours/wetness to your liking by adding more of any of the three ingredients.

6. Remove from heat. Garnish with green onions. Serve.

Notes

I canâ€™t get this to look like the pic, hence the low rating. In fact it is quite dry in general, despite our efforts. The tofu trick (adding corn starch) makes AMAZING tofu though, just like restaurants.
