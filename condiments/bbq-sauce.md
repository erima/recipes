Servings/Yield:  3 cups
Prep Time:  

Ingredients
============================
  2 Tbsp. olive oil
  2 red onions finely chopped
  One 3-inch piece ginger peeled and finely chopped
  4 garlic cloves finely chopped
  2 Tbsp. honey
  2 Tbsp. packed light brown sugar
  1 1/2 cups drained canned chopped tomatoes
  3/4 cup ketchup
  2 Tbsp Sweet Chile Sauce
  2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
  1/2 chipotle chile in adobo sauce roughly chopped
  2 Tbsp. tomato paste
  1 tsp. finely chopped rosemary
  1 cup strong brewed coffee

Directions
============================
  1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions, ginger, and garlic and saute until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the honey and brown sugar and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar melts and begins to caramelize, about 2 minutes.
  2. Add the tomatoes, ketchup, sweet chile sauce, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle, tomato paste, rosemary, thyme, coffee, and 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until the sauce is thickened and reduced by half, about 1 hour. Remove from the heat and let cool.
