Peanut Butter
=======================
Source: Gone Raw
Servings/Yield: 3/4 cup
Prep Time: 2 minutes

=======================
Ingredients

Ingredients: 
1 cup raw, shelled peanuts
1 tablespoon cold pressed peanut oil
pinch sea salt, if desired


=======================
Directions

Place the peanuts and salt in a food processor and process until the nuts are finely ground. Add the oil and continue processing until the peanut butter reaches your desired degree of smoothness, adding more oil if necessary. For chunky peanut butter, stir in 1/4 cup chopped peanuts. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator.

(If you want to use a blender, I suggest doing only about 1/4 cup peanuts at a time so you don’t burn the motor out! :-o )


=======================
Notes

Optional: add 1/4 tsp cinnamon, some honey, or your favorite spices/flavorings in while you’re blending.
