Prep Time: 30 mins, 4-5 days refrigeration

Ingredients: 
    1/4 cup brown mustard seeds     
    1/4 cup yellow mustard seeds  
    3/4 cup flat amber beer (or beer of your choice)  
    1 Tablespoon mustard flour  
    1 Tablespoon dried minced onion  
    2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves  
    1/2 cup cider vinegar  
    1 teaspoon salt  

Directions: 
Soak the mustard seeds in the beer overnight.  About 20 minutes before you are ready to make the mustard, stir the mustard flour, minced onion and thyme into the soaked seed mixture and allow to sit.   Place the mustard mixture to a blender (or food processor) along with the vinegar and salt.  Grind until the consistency of a paste, with some seeds remaining visible.  Transfer to a glass jar, cover and refrigerate 4-5 days before using.
