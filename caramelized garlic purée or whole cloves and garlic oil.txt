Servings/Yield: 
Prep Time: 45 minutes

Ingredients: 
	10 heads garlic, cloves separated and peeled
	1 1/2 cups olive oil

Directions: 
	Arrange the garlic cloves in a frying pan large enough to accommodate them in a single layer. Pour in the olive oil to cover the cloves (about 1 inch of oil), place over medium heat, and cook, stirring from time to time, for ten to fifteen minutes, or until the garlic softens and turns a beautiful golden brown. Remove from heat and, using a slotted spoon, scoop the garlic cloves from the oil and place them in a bowl. Let the cloves and the oil cool, returning any oil that collects in the bottom of the bowl to the frying pan.
	
	Once the garlic and oil have cooled, you can either purée some of the garlic into a paste , or package the whole cloves in zippered snack–size freezer bags. Don’t overfill the bags, packaging perhaps twenty to twenty–five cloves in each one. Freeze any bags that won’t be used within the next three days. Transfer the garlic oil to a glass or plastic container, cover, and refrigerate. It will keep for several months.

Notes: Puréed cloves are not as useful as far as I can tell.
