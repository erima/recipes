1. Mise En Place – Everything in it’s place is the organizing principle.
2. Mixing – In which three important requirements must be met - distribution of ingredients, development of gluten, and initiation of fermentation.
3. Primary Fermentation – Also called bulk fermentation, win which most of the flavor is determined.
4. Punching Down – Also called de–gassing, in which the dough begins to enter its secondary fermentation and individuation.
5. Dividing – in which pieces are weighed or scaled, while continuing to ferment.
6. Rounding – in which the pieces are given an interim shaping prior to their final shape.
7. Benching – also called resting, or intermediate proofing, during which time the gluten relaxes.
8. Shaping and Panning – in which the dough is given its final shape prior to baking.
9. Proofing – also called secondary or final fermentation, in which the dough is leavened to its appropriate baking size.
10. Baking – which may also include scoring the dough and steaming, but in which three vital oven actions must occur.
11. Cooling – which is really an extension of baking but must occur before cutting into the bread.
12. Storing and Eating – in production baking it’s primarily storing, but home baking usually emphasizes, ahem, eating.
