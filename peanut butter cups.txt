Servings/Yield: 12 cups
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	12 mini cupcake liners
	3/4 cup semisweet chopped chocolate
	1/2 cup peanut butter
	2 tablespoons peanut butter to add to melted chocolate
	1/4 cup powdered sugar
	1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
	pinch fine sea salt – if your PB is already salted, it's optional to add more

Directions: 
melt the chips in your microwave, keeping a close eye on them and stirring often to make sure they don’t burn. it should take between 1-2 minutes. add the 2 generous T and stir to incorporate.
give it about 5 minutes to cool down a bit, it’s easier to spread around when not lava-hot.

place a heaping teaspoon of melted chocolate in each mini cupcake liner and spread it all over the place with the back of a spoon. repeat with all 12 liners.

place the chocolate-covered liners onto a plate, into your fridge, to let it all harden.

meanwhile, stir together peanut butter, vanilla, salt, and sugar. if your peanut butter is anything like mine, it should form a sort of paste that you can start kneading to make sure all gets incorporated really well.

the chocolate should be hard by now, so divide peanut butter paste into all 12 liners, pressing down gently to make sure the paste goes everywhere.

top with heaping teaspoon of chocolate (melt it again if needed), spreading carefully so that none of the PB paste can be seen.

chill in fridge for at least one hour, until ready to devour.
