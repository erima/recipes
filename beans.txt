Selecting
Look for smooth surfaces and bright colors. Cracked seams or dull, wrinkled surfaces indicate dryness.

Storing
Store in an airtight glass jar away from heat. Use within six months.

Freezing
Cooked beans freeze very well; cook up extra and freeze for later use.

Preparing dried beans
Sort & Rinse: spread beans out on a clean kitchen towel or in a cake pan and remove shriveled beans and pebbles. Rinse in cold water.

Soak: Beans should be soaked. This is the vital step in bean digestibility (exceptions include short–cook beans). Add water: about 3 inches above beans, or 4-5 cups water per cup beans. Note: in warm weather, soak beans in the fridge to avoid fermentation.

Short soak/boil method: Boil beans in water for 3 minutes in a heavy–bottomed pot. Cover and set aside for 2–4 hours. Drain and discard water. Rinse beans before cooking. This method reduces the hard–to–digest complex sugars by 80%.

Long soak method: Soak beans for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and discard water. Rinse beans before cooking. This method is better than no soaking at all, but it does not remove the complex sugars as well as the short soak/boil method. 

Cooking

Cook beans in fresh water – not the water used for soaking – in a large, covered pot. (A pressure cooker shortens cooking time without lowering nutritional value.) Use 3-4 cups of water for each cup of dry beans. Water should be about 1 inch above the top of beans. Do not salt or add acidic flavoring until beans are cooked all the way through. Each cup of dry beans yields 2-2½ cups of cooked beans. 

Seasoning Beans
Cook from the start with these basic spices: chopped onion and garlic cloves; traditional digestive spices — bay leaves, cumin, epazote; kombu, a tenderizing sea vegetable available in bulk. Add any other seasonings 30 minutes before beans are due to be done. Spicing too early can cause the flavors to break down. The following items will toughen uncooked beans and increase cooking time considerably: salt/unrefined sea salt; miso, tamari and soy sauce; sugars; acidic ingredients, including tomatoes, wine and lemon. Add a final flash of flavor to cooked beans with one, two or three of the following: fresh lemon and grated Parmesan; yogurt; fruity olive oil and balsamic vinegar; toasted sesame oil, rice wine and soy sauce; red wine; miso and toasted sesame seeds; umeboshi (Japanese plum) vinegar or brown rice vinegar; fresh basil, cilantro, parsley, garlic, ground black pepper.
