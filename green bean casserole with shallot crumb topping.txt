Servings/Yield: 8
Prep Time: 

============================
Ingredients

* 2 lbs green beans, cut in half, trimmed and washed

Topping: 

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 cup shallots, finely diced
* 1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs
* 1 tbsp grated Romano or Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme (or 1 tsp fresh)

For the green beans:

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/3 cup shallots, minced
* 16 oz sliced mushrooms, (I used cremini)
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1 cup reduced sodium chicken stock (or vegetable for vegetarian)
* 1 cup 2% milk
* 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese

============================
Directions

Boil a large pot of water, when boiling add green beans and blanch for 2 minutes (or 6-8 minutes if you like them softer). Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop them from cooking.

Meanwhile make the topping, heat a medium-sized skillet over medium heat.  Add the shallots and sauté about 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally until golden brown. Reduce heat to medium-low, add breadcrumbs, grated cheese and thyme; sauté until golden brown, about 5-6 minutes, stirring frequently, careful not to burn.  

Preheat the oven to 375°. Lightly spray a 13 x 9 inch baking dish.

Heat oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sauté 1 to 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and sauté 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms, stir constantly for about a minute, then slowly add chicken stock, then milk. Bring to a low boil, and cook stirring occasionally until thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in Romano cheese. 

Add blanched green beens and mix well, season with salt and pepper as needed; pour into prepared baking dish. 

Top with toasted bread crumbs and bake about 30 minutes.
