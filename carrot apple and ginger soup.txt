Servings/Yield: 4
Prep Time: 60 minutes

Ingredients: 
	1 lb. carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
	1/2 lb. parsnips, cut into 1-inch pieces
	1 lb. Braeburn apples, cut into 1-inch pieces
	3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
	1/2 teaspoon sea salt, more to taste
	1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper, more to taste
	4 cups vegetable broth
	1 cup water
	1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated, to taste

Directions: 
	Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine carrots, parsnips, apples, olive oil, salt and pepper. Toss well to coat. Spread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 12 to 15 minutes, until soft and browned. Transfer to a large saucepan and cover with broth and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Stir in ginger and cook for 8 to 10 minutes longer. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Blend until smooth, using a regular blender or an immersion blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
	
	Serve hot soup with crisps.

Notes: 
	Cheese crisps go well. See other recipe for that.

	“This soup shows off a gorgeous orange color and warm ginger bite on the finish. A simple cheese cracker is the ideal counterpart to the heat of the ginger. Using an immersion blender is a great way to process soups and sauces without removing them from the stove, but you can certainly use a traditional blender as well.”
