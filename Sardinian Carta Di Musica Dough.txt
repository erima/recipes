Servings/Yield: 4-8 loaves
Prep Time: 3½ hours

=======================
Ingredients

5 cups bread flour, (22 1/2 ounces)
1 tablespoon sugar, or honey
2 teaspoons salt
1¾ teaspoons instant yeast
¼ cup olive oil, (or vegetable oil or shortening)
1⅔  cups water, room–temperature (70ºf)

bread flour, or corn meal or semolina flour


=======================
Directions

1. With a large metal spoon, stir together all the ingredients, in a 4–quart bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer until combined.

IF MIXING WITH AN ELECTRIC MIXER
Fit it with the dough hook and mix on low speed for about 4 minutes, or until the dough forms a course ball and clears the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Add more flour or water by the tablespoonful as needed. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then mix again on  low speed for an additional 2 to 4 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, stretchy, and tacky but not sticky. The dough should pass the windowpane test (see page 105).

IF MIXING BY HAND
Repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon into room–temperature water and use it much like a dough hook, working the dough vigorously as you rotate the bowl with your other hand. Continue mixing for about 4 minutes, or until the dough forms a course ball, adding more flour or water by the tablespoonful as needed. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then transfer it to a lightly floured counter. Dust the top with flour to absorb the surface moisture, then knead the dough by hand for 2 to 4 minutes, or until it is smooth, stretchy, and tacky but not sticky. The dough should pass the windowpane test (see page 105).

2. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl brushed with olive oil. Roll the dough in the oil to coat the entire surface and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough sit at room temperature for 1 to 1 1/2 hour, or until doubled in size.

3. Place a baking stone on the middle shelf of the oven (unless you know your oven well enough to place it on a different shelf) and preheat on the highest setting for one hour.

4. While the oven is heating, sprinkle some flour on the counter and transfer the dough from the bowl to the floured counter. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Round each piece into a ball, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand into a disk, and lay the disks a clean counter lightly dusted again with flour. Lightly dust the tops of the disks with more flour, cover them loosely with plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.

5. With a rolling pin, evenly roll out each disk into a rectangle or oblong about 10 by 7 inches. If the dough resists extending to the full size, cover it with a kitchen towel and let it rest for at least 5 minutes. Move on to another dough disk and then return to the first piece. When it is fully rolled, it should be a scant 1/4 inch thick. IF it is slightly longer or shorter than the 10 inches or is not a perfect rectangle, yet appears to be the proper thickness, stop rolling. Let the rolled–out dough rest uncovered on the counter for about 3 minutes, then gently lift one (you may need a metal or plastic scraper) onto a wooden or metal peel that has been lightly dusted with flour.

6. Slide the dough from the peel onto the stone, close the oven door, and wait for 2 minutes before opening the door. The dough should begin separating horizontally into 2 thin halves, puffing up into a large pita–like bread. When this occurs, count to 20 and then remove the bread, placing it on a wire rack to cool; do not wait for it to brown or crisp. While the first piece is baking, prepare the next piece and continue in this manner until all 4 pieces are baked. If any do not begin to puff and separate within 4 minutes, remove them from the oven and use them as soft flatbreads.

7. When the puffed breads have cooled, they will release  all their air and flatten. Separate the halves with a sharp, serrated knife into 2 very thin disks (one side may be thinner than the other, but unless it is too thin to hold together, it will be okay). These halved breads may be used in this soft form for pizza crusts, or they can be crisped in the same preheated oven and used either as ultra–crisp pizza crusts or cracker bread (carta di musica).

8. To make crisp crusts, place as many halved pieces as will fit on the baking stone or inverted sheet pan in the still–hot oven and bake for about 5 minutes, or until the disks begin to brown and curl. Remove them from the oven to a wire rack and cool.
