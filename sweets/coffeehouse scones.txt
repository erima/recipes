Servings/Yield:  6-8 scones
Prep Time: 40 minutes

Ingredients: 
2 cups (260 grams) all purpose flour
¼ cup (50 grams) granulated white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon salt
½ cup (113 grams) (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cut into pieces
⅔ - ¾ cup (160 - 180 ml) buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions: 
Preheat oven to 400º F (200º C) and place rack in middle of oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.  Add the buttermilk and vanilla extract to the flour mixture and stir just until the dough comes together. Do not over mix.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough gently and form into a round that is about 1" (2.5 cm) thick. Use a 2½" (6.5 cm) round biscuit cutter to cut the dough into circles. Transfer the scones to the baking sheet and brush the tops of the scones with a little milk.

Bake for about 20 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.


Notes: 
“Coffeehouse Scones are great plain, but they are also excellent when 1/2 cup of dried fruit or fresh berries, or 1/2 cup of chocolate chips or chopped nuts are added to the dough.”
