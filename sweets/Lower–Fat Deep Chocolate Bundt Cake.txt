Servings/Yield: 12 (1 cake)
Prep Time: 70 minutes

Ingredients: 
	1 3/4 cups fresh brewed coffee
	2/3 cup unsweetened Dutch–processed cocoa powder
	1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
	1/3 cup canola oil
	1/3 cup applesauce
	1/4 cup cornstarch
	2 teaspoons vanilla extract
	1 teaspoon almond extract
	2 cups whole wheat pastry flour or all–purpose white flour
	1 teaspoon baking soda
	1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 teaspoons confectioners’ sugar

Directions: 
	Preheat the oven to 325ºF. Lightly grease an 8 or 10 inch Bundt pan.
	
	Bring the coffee to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Once it is simmering, turn down the heat and whisk in the cocoa powder until it has dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside to bring to room temperature. 

	In a mixing bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, canola oil, applesauce, and cornstarch until the sugar and cornstarch are dissolved, about 2 minutes. Mix in the extracts. Once the chocolate has cooled a bit, mix that in as well.

	Sift in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Beat until relatively smooth, about 1 minute with a hand mixer or 2 minutes with a whisk.

	Sift in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Beat until relatively smooth, about 1 minute with a hand mixer  or two minutes with a whisk.

	Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan and bake for about 45 minutes, until a toothpick or butter knife inserted through its center comes out clean. If your pan is on the smaller side, it could take up to 55 minutes.

	Remove from the oven and let cool for about 20 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate to cool completely. Once cool, sift confectioners’ sugar over the top and enjoy. 

Notes: 
	I used instant espresso we had around but kept the same about of water as indicated.
