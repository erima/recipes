Prep Time:  60 minutes

Ingredients: 
	•	1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
	•	1 ½ cups plain soymilk
	•	2 1/8 cups flour
	•	2 tsp baking powder
	•	½ tsp baking soda
	•	½ tsp salt
	•	1 1/8 cups sugar
	•	½ cup oil
	•	1 ¼ tsp vanilla extract
	•	½ tsp. coconut extract (optional)
	
Directions: 
	Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 4/350º. Spray 22 muffin cups with nonstick spray or line with paper cupcake liners (I like to spray the inside of the muffin papers with nonstick spray to help the cupcakes release). Set aside.
	
	Place the apple cider vinegar in the bottom of a liquid measuring cup and fill the cup with soymilk to equal 1 ½ cups. Stir well and set aside (the mixture will curdle).
	
	In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In another mixing bowl whisk together the soymilk mixture, oil, vanilla, and (optional) coconut extract. Add the wet to the dry ingredients and beat until smooth using a hand-held mixer.
	
	Fill each muffin cup with at least ¼ cup of batter. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the middle of a cupcake comes out clean.
	
	Let cool in the pans for 5 minutes, then remove cupcakes from the pan and place on a wire rack. Let the cupcakes cool completely before frosting.
