Prep Time: 40 minutes

Ingredients: 
	3 lbs. russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks
	salt, to taste
	1 cup milk
	6 tablespoons butter
	pepper, to taste

Directions: 
	Put potatoes into a large pot, cover with salted water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes more. 
	
	Meanwhile, put milk and butter into a small pot and heat over medium heat until butter is just melted and mixture is hot; cover and keep warm. 
	
	Drain potatoes and return to pot. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until potatoes have dried out and most of the steam is gone, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove pot from the heat, add milk mixture, salt and pepper and beat with an electric mixer until smooth, about 1 minute. Alternately, mash with a potato masher until just chunky. Transfer to a large bowl and serve.
