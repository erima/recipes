=======================
Ingredients

1 cup brown rice (uncooked)
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic
1 medium onion, diced
2 bell peppers (any color!), chopped
1 lb extra firm tofu diced into cubes
2 teaspoons paprika
1 tablespoon cumin
1 teaspoon corriander
1 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 15 oz cans of black beans, rinsed
1 15 oz can of diced tomatoes, with juice
1/4 cup tomato paste
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 cup fresh or frozen corn


=============================
Directions

Start your brown rice cooking on the stove or in your rice cooker first.  You’ll need this after about 20 minutes of cooking the other ingredients.  In your food processor, blend 1 can of black beans with 1 can of diced tomatoes, set aside.  (If you don’t have a food processor, you could use a blender.)

Heat oil in a large pan (we use our 5 quart saute pan, but a large wok works too) and saute garlic and onions for 1-2 minutes.  Add bell peppers and cook until the peppers are tender (5-7 minutes).  Add the tofu and spices and cook for 5 more minutes.  Now add the cooked brown rice, tomato-bean mix, the other can of black beans, tomato paste, soy sauce and frozen corn.  Cook another 5-10 minutes until everything is heated and mixed completely.

Serve in a wrap or in a bowl garnished with chopped green olives, salsa and avocado.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
