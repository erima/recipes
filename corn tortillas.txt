Corn Tortillas (without a press)

Servings/Yield: 16
Prep Time: 1 minute prep, 5 minutes rest, 30 minutes cooking

=======================
Ingredients

2 c. masa harina
1¼ c. warm water*


=======================
Directions


In a bowl, combine masa harina and water.  Continue mixing until a dough has formed, lightly kneading for a few minutes.  Set aside for about 5 minutes.

While the dough is resting, cut 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic from a large freezer bag.  (I realized I was out of wax paper and large ziplocs, so I did one piece of parchment and one piece of plastic wrap. I figured that only plastic wrap would be too clingy to maneuver on top and the parchment only would curl up on the bottom, how’s that for some yankee ingenuity?)

The 2 cups flour will make 16 tortillas, so to keep them all (roughly) equal, I first divide the dough into 2 balls, then quarter each half, and half each quarter again.  Roll each section of dough into balls, roughly the size of a golf ball.

Heat a dry skillet or griddle over high heat.

You will make one tortilla at a time, pressing the next while one is cooking.  Place one piece of the paper on flat surface, top with a ball of dough and another piece of paper.  Using a heavy book or skillet, press down to flatten.

Pick up the tortilla and papers in one hand, gently peel on the back piece of paper, and transfer hands.  Gently peel of the top piece of paper next, letting half the tortilla hang from your hand (think very light patty-cake).

Carefully place the tortilla on the hot pan, and let cook 30 seconds on the first side, flip and let cook 1 minute on the alternate side. Flip back and cook another 30 seconds on the first side.  The tortilla will be slightly golden and start to puff up a bit.

Remove to a tortilla warmer or a plate lined with dish towel or cloth napkin to keep warm.

Repeat with remaining 15 tortillas.

Serve warm or refrigerate and reheat.
