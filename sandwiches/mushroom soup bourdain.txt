Ingredients

6 tablespoons butter
1 onion, thinly sliced
12 ounces button mushrooms, halved
4 cups broth
1 sprig parsley
2 ounces sherry
salt and pepper

Directions

Over medium heat, melt two tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan. Toss in the onion and cook until soft but not browned.

Toss in the remaining butter and then add the mushrooms. Cook for 8 minutes.

Pour in the broth, add the parsley, and bring to a boil. When bubbling, reduce to a simmer and cook for an hour.

Pour soup into a blender (you might need to do this in stages), and process until smooth. Return to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. Pour in the sherry, and season with salt and pepper.
