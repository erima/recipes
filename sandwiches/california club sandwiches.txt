Directions: 
	Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the tempeh bacon and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.
	
	Lightly toast the bread and spread with soy mayonnaise. Place 2 slices of the prepared toast on the cutting board. Layer each slice with lettuce, tomato, avocado, and the tempeh bacon. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Top each with the remaining toast. Use a serrated bread knife to cut each sandwich in half diagonally and serve at once.
