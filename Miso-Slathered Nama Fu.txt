Ingredients

NAMA FU DOUGH
½ cup vital wheat gluten, tapped down and leveled, about 3½ ounces
2 tablespoons mochiko, about ½ ounce
½ teaspoon ao nori
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
¼ cup warm water

MUGI MISO DENGAKU SAUCE
2 tablespoons mugi miso
scant 1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon saké
2 tablespoons stock, preferably Basic Kelp Stock (see Kansha book), or cold water

½ teaspoon aromatic sesame oil (optional)
1 teaspoon each white and black sesame seeds, freshly dry-roasted

=============================
Directions

Make the dough: Combine the vital wheat gluten and mochiko in a bowl and stir to mix thoroughly. Divide the mixture evenly among two bowls. Add the ao nori to one bowl and add the turmeric to the other bowl. Stir the contents of each bowl to mix thoroughly. Then add two tablespoons of water to each bowl a spoonful at a time, stirring to mix. Gather the contents of each bowl into a smooth, soft ball of dough, and place each ball in a small, sturdy resealable plastic bag. Seal the bags and let both doughs rest for at least two hours or up to eight hours at cool room temperature. During this resting time, the dough will become soft, stretchy, and slightly sticky. If you want to keep the doughs longer, you can refridgerate them for up to two days but bring them back to room temperature before continuing. 

Meanwhile, make the dengaku sauce: Combine the miso, sugar, saké, and stock in a small saucepan and stir well to combine. Place over low heat and cook, stirring frequently, for about five minutes, or until glossy, aromatic, and the consistency of tomato paste. The sauce can sputter and splatter, so use a long-handled wooden spoon or silicone spatula to stir to prevent burns. Remove from the heat and allow the sauce to cool naturally to room temperature. The sauce will stiffen as it cools. (The sauce can be made up to two weeks in advance, then refrigerated in a glass jar with a tight fitting lid.)

Remove the rested balls of dough from the plastic bags. They will be slightly sticky. Gently roll each ball between your palms to form a cylinder about five inches long and one inch in diameter. Set each roll on a damp eight-inch square of sarashi or other finely woven cloth. (The cloths will become tinted yellow and green, respectively, but they can be reused several times, rinsing and drying after each use.) Roll up to enclose, and secure the ends with rubber bands.

Ready a steamer. When the steam is flowing freely, place the rolls in the steamer and steam for ten to twelve minutes. They will become slightly aromatic and very firm. Remove the steamer from the stove top, but keep it lidded. Allow the rolls to rest for twenty to thirty minutes. Remove the rolls from the steamer and rinse them briefly under cold running water. Shake off the excess moisture, then remove the cloth from each roll. The ao nori roll will have become quite green and the turmeric roll a golden yellow. Place the rolls in a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to serve. They will keep for up to five days. Or, wrap snugly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to three weeks; thaw them slowly in the refrigerator. Once they are thawed, use them within twenty-four hours. 

When ready to serve, slice each roll into disks about ¼-inch thick. Arrange these flat on a piece of aluminum foil that will fit under your broiler or on the tray of a toaster oven. If you are concerned about the stickiness of the disks, lightly grease the foil with sesame oil. Using a small spatula or knife, spread a bit of the dengaku sauce on each disk. Broil the disks for two minutes, or until the sauce becomes bubbly, aromatic, and slightly crusted. Allow the disks to cool for one minute, then peel them off the foil. 

To make serving – and eating – simple, thread two or three disks onto a wooden skewer (the skewers will be easier to insert into disks that are still warm). You can mix colors (and flavors) on a single skewwer or keep them separate. Continue until all disks are threaded onto skewers. Garnish with the sesame seeds and serve.
