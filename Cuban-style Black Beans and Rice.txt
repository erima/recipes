Ingredients

2 cups brown rice
4 cups spring water
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
3 cups black beans, drained
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
14.5 ounces diced tomatoes, with liquid
sea salt, to taste
ground pepper, to taste
fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
1 lime, wedged (for garnish)


===================================================================
Directions

Place rice in a strainer and rinse under cool running water. Heat a stainless steel or cast iron skillet over low heat and add rice. Dry roast the rice for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until rice is dry and aromatic. 

Place the roasted rice in a pot. Add the water and salt and cover with a lid. Bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 1 hour, or until the water is absorbed and rice is tender. Remove from heat. For fluffier rice, after the rice comes to a boil, place it in a covered casserole dish and place in a preheated 225°F oven for one hour. 

Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium high heat. When pan is hot, add olive oil. Add the onion and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the bell pepper, garlic and chili powder. Continue to sauté for 2 more minutes. Reduce heat to low, add diced tomatoes and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes. Add beans and simmer 5 minutes longer to heat through. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. 

Serve beans over brown rice with cilantro and lime wedges.
