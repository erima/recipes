Ingredients

In a medium soup pot, cover the potatoes and garlic with water, bring to a boil, and simmer for about 20 minutes, until tender. Drain the potatoes, reserving the stock for soup, and place them in a large bowl. Add the sour cream or yogurt, egg white, parsley, scallions, dill, and lemon juice and mash thoroughly. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Put the bread crumbs in a large shallow bowl and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350ยบ.

With your hands, spread the olive oil on a large baking sheet. (Having oiled hands will make it easier for you to work with the sticky batter.) Scoop 1/4 cup of the potato mixture into your hands and shape it into a patty. Coat the patty evenly with bread crumbs on both sides, place it on the baking sheet, and continue until all of the potato mixture is used. You will have about 14 patties.

Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Flip the potato cakes over and bake for 10 more minutes, or until browned and heated through.
