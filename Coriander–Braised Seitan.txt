Coriander–Braised Seitan

Source: Cooking With Seitan
Servings/Yield: 4 – 6 servings
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	4 cups seitan (~ 2 lbs)
	1 tablespoon sesame oil
	1 tablespoon toasted (dark) sesame oil
	1 tablespoon fresh garlic, minced
	1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
	3 tablespoons molasses
	3 tablespoons soy sauce
	3 tablespoons ground coriander
	1 teaspoon black pepper
	1/8 teaspoon hot pepper oil
	1/2 cup rice wine
	3 scallions, cut into 2–inch lengths

Directions: 
	Using forks, pull apart seitan into irregular shapes.
	
	In a heavy skillet with a cover, heat the two types of sesame oil together over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, and sauté until the garlic begins to brown (2 – 5 minutes). 

	Add the seitan pieces to the skillet and sauté over medium heat until browned and a little crispy (about 15 minutes). 

	While the seitan is browning, combine the molasses, soy sauce, coriander, black pepper, and hot pepper oil in a small bowl. Add this mixture to the skillet, coating the seitan evenly. Add the rice wine. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.

	Uncover the skillet, add the scallions, and increase the heat to high. Continue to simmer the seitan for about 1 minute, or until the liquid has been reduced to a coating for the seitan.

Notes: 
	Serve over couscous or brown rice as a main or side dish. As an appetizer, serve Coriander–Braised Seitan with chilled radishes and cucumbers.
