Servings/Yield: 4
Prep Time: 

===================================================================
Ingredients

2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon agave nectar
1 large clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
0 to taste sea salt
0 to taste ground pepper
16 ounces extra firm tofu
1 medium yellow onion, halved and cut into thick slices
2 large white mushroom, sliced
1 large carrot, cut in half and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon butter
3 Fuji apples, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces
1/4 cup chopped parsley, for garnish

===================================================================
Directions

Preheat the oven to 400°F. 

Combine the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, agave nectar, garlic, oregano, thyme, sea salt and pepper in a mixing bowl. 

Drain the tofu and gently press to remove as much liquid as possible. Cut tofu into 8 equal slices. Pierce the tofu in several places with a fork to allow the flavor of the marinade to penetrate. Pour balsamic mixture over tofu and marinate for 15 to 20 minutes. 

Transfer tofu to a shallow 9x13-inch baking pan. Add onion, mushrooms and carrots. Pour balsamic marinade over tofu and vegetables, brushing to coat everything. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake for 10 minutes. Turn the tofu and continue to bake an additional 10 minutes. 

Meanwhile, prepare apples. In a skillet over medium heat, heat the margarine or canola oil. Add the apple slices and sauté until tender and lightly browned but not mushy, about 10 to 15 minutes. 

When cooked, garnish tofu and vegetables with parsley and serve alongside sautéed apples.

Notes

"Apples, herbs and veggies give this baked tofu dish a pleasing flavor boost wonderful cool weather fare. Serve over brown or wild rice with a side salad such as endive (frisée) with grated beets and a lemon juice vinaigrette."
