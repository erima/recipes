Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	1 pound dark roast coffee and chicory, medium ground
	10 cups cold water
	Ice
	Milk
	
Directions: 
	1. Put coffee in a nonreactive container, like a stainless-steel stockpot. Add 2 cups water, stirring gently to wet the grounds, then add remaining 8 cups water, agitating the grounds as little as possible. Cover and let steep at room temperature for 12 hours.

	2. Strain coffee concentrate through a medium sieve, then again through a fine-mesh sieve.

	3. To make iced coffee, fill a glass with ice, add ¼ cup coffee concentrate and 3/4 to 1 cup milk, then stir. To make café au lait, warm 3/4 to 1 cup milk in a saucepan or microwave, then pour into a mug and add ¼ cup coffee concentrate. (Concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.)

Notes: 
	Coffee with chicory may be ordered through French Market
