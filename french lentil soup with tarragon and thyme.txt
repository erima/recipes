Ingredients: 
	1 tablespoon olive oil
	1 large yellow onion, diced
	1 large carrot, peeled and cut into fine dice
	5 plum tomatoes, seeded and diced
	4 cloves garlic
	2 teaspoons dried tarragon

	1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions: 
	Preheat a large soup pot over medium heat. Sauté the onions and the carrots for about 10 minutes, until the onions have browned a bit. Add thee garlic, tarragon, thyme, and paprika, and sauté for 2 more minutes. Add the tomatoes and a little splash of water if necessary, to deglaze the pot. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes.
	
	Add the water/broth, lentils, bay leaves, salt, and pepper, then cover and bring to a boil. Once the soup is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 45 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. If the soup looks too thin, uncover and simmer  for a couple more minutes. If the soup looks too thick, add a little more water. Serve with good, crusty bread.
