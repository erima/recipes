Soft Pretzels

Servings/Yield: 
Prep Time: 2 hours

## Ingredients: 
* 1-1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 1-1/4 cup water, lukewarm (105 to 115 deg F) 
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 4 cups unbleached flour
* 1 tablespoon sunflower oil, maybe 2 tablespoons

### Baking
* 4 cups water
* 4 teaspoons baking soda
* coarse salt
	
## Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast completely in one-fourth cup of the warm water. Stir in the remaining cup of water along with the sugar. 
	
Mix in the salt. Beat in the flour, mixing well to form a stiff dough that holds together. Try adding the first cup of flour a half-cup at a time and it will go more smoothly.

On a floured board, knead until the dough is elastic and smooth, about ten minutes, using additional flour for the board and your hands as needed. 
	
Place the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl, brush or spread all exposed areas with a light coating of oil or margarine, and cover lightly with a tea towel. Allow to rest at room temperature until the dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes. 
	
Preheat oven to 475 deg F. Place four cups of water in a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven. Stir in the baking soda and bring to a boil. 
	
While the water is heating, start shaping the dough into pretzels (traditional sticks and twists, or any shape you like). The dough shapes should be between one-half and three-quarters of an inch thick, depending on how thick you want the finished pretzels to be. 
	
	When the water reaches boiling, carefully drop in two or three of the pretzels and let boil until they float to the top, about one minute. Remove with a slotted pancake turner and to a cooling rack and let drain. Repeat with remaining pretzel shapes. 
	
Lightly coat a baking sheet with oil or margarine, and place the boiled pretzels onto the sheet. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake until golden brown, about 12 to 14 minutes. Remove to the cooling rack and serve warm. 
	
Store pretzels for a few days at room temperature, or they can be frozen once they've cooled. Keep them in an airtight container to preserve the texture. Frozen pretzels can be thawed at room temperature or in a low (300 deg F) oven for a few minutes until soft.

## Notes: 
Swap out 1 tablespoon of unbleached flour for 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour.
