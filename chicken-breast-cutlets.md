Servings/Yield:  10
Prep Time:  

Ingredients
============================
* 4 cups plain panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 teaspoon coarse salt
* Coarse salt and pepper
* 4 large eggs
* 2 pounds chicken cutlets (about 10)
* 1/3 cup all-purpose flour

Directions
============================
Prepare cutlets: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Toss panko, olive oil, and 1 teaspoon salt on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring twice, until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely. (Crush a few handfuls, to help crumbs adhere.) Whisk eggs in a bowl. Pat dry chicken cutlets; season with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour, tapping off excess. Dip in eggs; coat with panko, patting to adhere. Lay cutlets in layers on a baking sheet, with parchment in between each. Freeze 2 hours, then up to 1 month in resealable plastic bags.

Bake cutlets: Arrange on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees, flipping once, until cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. (If cutlets are not frozen, bake 8 to 10 minutes.)
