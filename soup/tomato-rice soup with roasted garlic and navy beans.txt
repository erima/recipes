Tomato-rice soup with roasted garlic and navy beans
Source: Veganomicon
Servings/Yield: 10 to 12
Prep Time: 45 minutes (+45 minutes roasted garlic, possibly at the same time as this)

Ingredients: 
	2 bulbs garlic
	1 tablespoon olive oil
	1 medium-size yellow onion, diced as small as possible
	1 cup long-grain brown rice
	2 bay leaves
	2 teaspoons dried thyme
	1 teaspoon marjoram
	2 teaspoons salt
	several pinches of freshly ground black pepper
	2 (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
	1 (15-ounce) can navy beans, drained and rinsed (about 1 1/2 cups)
	56 ounces of water (two crushed tomato cans worth)
	
Directions: 	
	Preheat the oven to 425ºF if you need to roast garlic. Following the directions for ROASTED GARLIC, roast the garlic for about 45 minutes, until soft. You should be able to feel if it’s soft by pressing with a knife or your finger. Don’t burn yourself, though. 
	
	Preheat the soup pot over medium heat. Sauté the onions in the olive oil for 5 to 7 minutes, until translucent.
	
	Add the rice, bay leaves, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, then fill up the can with water twice and add the water (so that’s 56 ounces of water).
	
	Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 45 minutes. Remove the garlic from the oven (presuming you followed the ROASTED GARLIC recipe). When it is cool enough to handle, squeeze the roasted garlic out of its skin and into a small bowl. Use a fork to mash the garlic to a relatively smooth consistency, then add to the soup once the rice is nearly tender. 
	
	When the rice is completely cooked, add the beans and heat through. Then it’s ready to serve – just remove the bay leaves beforehand.
