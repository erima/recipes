1 cup brown lentils 
6 cups vegetable stock

Pick through the lentils and remove any rocks or foreign objects that may be present. Rinse the lentils in water, drain, and set aside until ready to use.

Bring the vegetable stock to a boil in a large pot over high heat. When it reaches a boil, add the lentils, celery, carrot, garlic, onion, olive oil, tomato sauce, and bay leaf. Return to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer the soup, partially covered, for 45 minutes. Chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces and add them to the soup. Cook for about 20 minutes longer or until the potatoes are cooked through. Add the red wine vinegar, season with salt and pepper as necessary, and serve.
