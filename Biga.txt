Servings/Yield: Makes about 18 ounces (enough for Ciabatta, Biga Version, page 140; or Italian Bread, page 172)
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	2 1/2 cups (11.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour
	1/2 teaspoon (.055 ounce) instant yeast
	3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons to 1 cup (7 to 8 ounces) water, at room temperature
	
Directions: 
	1. Stir together the flour and yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (or mix on low speed for 1 minute with teh paddle attachment). Adjust the flour or water, according to need, so that the dough is neither too sticky nor too stiff. (It is better to err on the sticky side, as you can adjust easier during kneading. It is harder to add water once the dough firms up.)
	
	2. Sprinkle some flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead for 4 to 6 minutes (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook for 4 minutes), or until the dough is soft and pliable, tack but not sticky. The internal temperature should be 77ºF to 81ºF.
	
	3. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, or until it nearly doubles in size.
	
	4. Remove the dough from the bowl, knead it lightly to degas, and return it to the bowl, covering the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight. You can keep this in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze it in an airtight plastic bag for up to 3 months.
	
	
Notes: 
	Biga can be substituted for Poolish, as long as final water formula is adjusted. Can be used immediately after fermentation but will lack some of the flavor profile from overnight refrigeration.
