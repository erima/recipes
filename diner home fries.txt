Servings/Yield: 4 to 6
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 4 to 6 potatoes), cut in half lengthwise, sliced 1/3 inch thick or so
	3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
	1 green pepper, seeded, cut into 1⁄2-inch wide, inch-long pieces
	1 medium onion, cut into 1⁄2-inch wide, inch-long pieces
	3⁄4 teaspoon salt 1⁄2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions: 
	Place potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn heat down just a bit (to medium high) and cook for about 15 more minutes, until potatoes are thoroughly cooked but still firm. Drain well.
	
	Preheat a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil and let the oil get hot. Add the potatoes and flip them around with a spatula to coat in oil. Let them cook undisturbed for about 5 to 7 minutes; they should be lightly browned. If not then bring the heat up a bit. Toss them and let cook for 10 more minutes, flipping occasionally to brown all sides. They won’t all get browned and crispy; just do your best.
	
	Add the peppers, onions, salt and pepper, and another tablespoon of oil and cook for 5 to 7 more minutes, stirring often, until onions and peppers are cooked.
