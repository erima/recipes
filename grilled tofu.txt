Grilled Tofu

If not cut already, cut the tofu widthwise into four equal pieces.  Marinate for an hour, flipping over after 30 minutes.

Grease a stove-top grill pan (preferably cast iron) with vegetable oil. Preheat over a high flame for about 3 minutes. Use tongs to distribute the tofu slabs evenly onto the grill. Gently use the tongs to press the tofu into the grill ridges, to get nice dark lines. Cook for 3 minutes on one side without lifting, then turn the slabs 90ยบ to create a crosshatched pattern on the bottom of the tofu. Cook for 2 minutes, then flip over and cook for another 2 minutes. Move to a cutting board and cut each piece diagonally across into two triangles with a sharp knife.
