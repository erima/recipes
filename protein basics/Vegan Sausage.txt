Servings/Yield: 6
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	1/2 cup pinto beans, rinsed and drained
	1 cup cold vegetable broth
	1 tablespoon olive oil
	2 tablespoons soy sauce
	2 cloves garlic, grated (with a microplane, or very finely minced)
	1 1/4 cups vital wheat gluten
	1/4 cup nutritional yeast
	1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seed, crushed
	1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
	1 teaspoon sweet paprika
	1 teaspoon dried oregano
	fresh black pepper, to taste


Directions: 
	1. Before mixing your ingredients, get your steaming apparatus ready, bring water to a full boil. The rest of the recipe comes together very quickly.

	2. Have ready 6 sheets of tin foil. In a large bowl, mash the pinto beans until no whole ones are left. Throw all the other ingredients together in the order listed and mix with a fork. Divide dough into 6 even parts. Place one part of dough into tin foil and mold into about a 5 inch log. Wrap dough in tin foil, like a tootsie roll. Don’t worry too much about shaping it, it will snap into shape while it’s steaming because this recipe is awesome.

	3. Place wrapped sausages in steamer and steam for 40 minutes.
