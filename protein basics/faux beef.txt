Servings/Yield: 2 large or 4 small servings
Prep Time: 1 1/2 hours (see note)

Ingredients:
Basic Instant Gluten

Broth:
2 cups water
1/4 cup tamari
2 teaspoons vegan Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried sage

Directions:

	In a large saucepan, bring all of the broth ingredients to a boil. Slice Basic Instant Gluten into steaks, chunks or strips and drop carefully into broth. Reduce heat and cover with lid. Let simmer for 50-60 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until broth has reduced completely.

	Use "beef" immediately in your dish of choice or store in the refrigerator (for up to 6 days) or the freezer (for up to 6 months). For a chewier texture, once you've boiled the "beef", bake it at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a lightly oiled baking dish for 30 minutes.
