Source: Cooking with Seitan
Servings/Yield: 6
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	4 cups (~ 2 lbs) seitan pieces (1 1/2 x 2 1/2 inches)
	3 tablespoons toasted (dark) sesame oil
	2 cloves garlic
	3 tablespoons soy sauce
	3 tablespoons mirin
	8 cloves Chinese star anise*
	2 tablespoons brown rice syrup
	1/4 teaspoon Chinese hot pepper oil
	2 cups water
	2 scallions, slivered for garnish

Directions: 
	In a heavy pot with a cover, heat the sesame oil over medium heat. Add the seitan pieces and brown them until crispy (5 â€“ 7 minutes each side).

	Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and lower the heat. Cover and simmer for 2 hours, turning the pieces every 20 minutes for even cooking.
	
	Transfer seitan to a serving bowl and top with the simmered sauce. Garnish with scallions and serve warm or cold.

Notes: 
	* one section of a "star" is considered one clove.
