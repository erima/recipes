BASIC INSTANT GLUTEN

Source: VegFamily.com
Servings/Yield: 2 large or 4 small servings (~6 oz)
Prep Time: 5 minutes

Ingredients: 
	1/2 cup (~2.25oz.) instant vital wheat gluten flour
	1/2 cup (4oz.)  water

Directions: 
	In a medium bowl, stir together the wheat gluten and water until it becomes elastic. Knead for 5 minutes and set aside. Choose a mock meat flavouring (recipes for flavourings on page 284-5 of La Dolce Vegan) to use with your prepared dough. 
	
Notes: 
	This should be combined with spices and flavorings into a "meat." After that it still needs to be made into a full dish. (Eg- faux chicken, or even more advanced "Jay-Loâ€™s Fried Chicken")
	
	2013-06-04 - I'm not sure about the weights above. On my scale I weighed two 1/4 cups as 1.6 oz. I don't remember if I added the weights above or they were part of the recipe. I also add a little nutritional yeast  (1tbsp or so) to each batch.
