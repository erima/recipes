Servings/Yield: 3
Prep Time: 45 minutes 

Ingredients:
	1 lb. tofu
	1/8 cup soy sauce

Directions:
	Preheat oven to 375 F.
	
	Slice tofu 1/4-inch thick. Brush each slice, back and front, with soy sauce and allow it to marinate for 10 minutes.
	
	Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake for 30-35 minutes, turning once halfway through, until a deep, golden brown and crispy on the outside but still tender on the inside. Remove from oven.
	
	If using in a stir-fry, cut each slice of tofu into 8 cubes and add to stir-fry near the end.

Notes:
	I used a wide tupperware container to marinate, and probably 3x the amount of soy sauce as it was absorbed too quickly.
