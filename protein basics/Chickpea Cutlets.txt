Servings/Yield: 4 cutlets
Prep Time: 30 minutes

Ingredients: 
	1 cup cooked chickpeas
	2 tablespoons olive oil
	1/2 cup vital wheat gluten
	1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
	1/4 cup vegetable broth or water
	2 tablespoons soy sauce
	2 cloves garlic, pressed or grated with a microplane grater
	1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
	1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
	1/2 teaspoon Hungarian paprika
	1/4 teaspoon dried rubbed sage
	Olive oil for pan frying

Directions: 
	In a mixing bowl, mash the chickpeas together with the oil until no whole chickpeas are left. Add the remaining ingredients and knead for about 3 minutes until strings of gluten have formed. 

	Preheat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Meanwhile, divide the cutlet dough into four equal pieces. To form the cutlets, knead  each piece in your hand for a few moments and then flatten and stretch each one into a roughly 6 x 4 inch rectangular cutlet shape. The easiest way to do this is to first form a rectangular shape in your hands and then place the cutlets on a clean surface to flatten and stretch them.

	Add a moderately thin layer of olive oil to the bottom of the pan. Place the cutlets in the pan and cook on each side for 6 to 7 minutes. Add more oil, if needed, when you flip the cutlets. They’re ready when lightly browned and firm to the touch.

	Just in case you were wondering, you can also bake these too! Baking gives these patties some toothsome chewy texture and firm bite. Preheat the oven to 375ºF, lightly oil baking sheet. Brush both sides of each patty with olive oil, place on baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. FLip patties and bake another 8 – 10 minutes till firm and golden–brown.
