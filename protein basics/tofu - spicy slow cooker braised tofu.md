Servings/Yield: 4
Prep Time: 3 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours

Ingredients
============================
* 2 (1-pound) boxes extra-firm tofu, drained
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/4 cup gochujang sauce
* 1 (8-ounce) package baby spinach
* 4 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions
============================
Wrap tofu in several layers of paper towels, and arrange tofu on plate. Cover tofu with another plate or heavy can and let sit for a few minutes to remove as much liquid as possible. Repeat as needed. Unwrap tofu, discarding paper towels.

Cut tofu into 3/4-inch-thick slices and place in the bottom of a slow cooker, keeping them in one layer if possible. Sprinkle with salt and drizzle with gochujang. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours or on high for 3 hours. Add spinach, cover and cook on low until spinach is just wilted, about 45 minutes. Serve tofu with spinach and sprinkle with green onions.
