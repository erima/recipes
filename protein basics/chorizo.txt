Chorizo

Source: Vegan Brunch
Servings/Yield: 4
Prep Time: 

=====================
Ingredients

1⁄2 cup cooked pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup vegetable broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons tomato paste 
2 teaspoons lemon zest
2 garlic cloves, grated (with a microplane, or very finely minced)
1 1⁄4 cups vital wheat gluten
1⁄4 cup nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon dry rubbed sage (not powdered)
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne (optional; don’t use if you don’t like heat)

=====================
Directions

Before mixing your ingredients, get your steaming apparatus ready and bring water to a full boil. The rest of the recipe comes together very quickly.

Have ready four sheets of tinfoil. In a large bowl, mash the beans until no whole ones are left. Throw all the other ingredients together in the order listed and mix with a fork. Divide dough into four even parts (an easy way to do this: split the dough in half and then into quarters). Place one part of dough into tin- foil and mold into about a 5-inch log. Wrap dough in tinfoil, like a Tootsie Roll. Don’t worry too much about shaping it; it will snap into shape while it’s steaming because this recipe is awesome.

Place wrapped sausages in steamer and steam for 40 minutes.
