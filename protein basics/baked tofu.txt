Baked Tofu

Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF.

If not cut already, cut the tofu widthwise into eight equal pieces. Marinate for an hour, flipping over after 30 minutes.

Place the tofu on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Flip over and bake for another 10 minutes. Place in the broiler for about 3 more minutes for extra chewiness.
