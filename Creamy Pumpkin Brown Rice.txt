Prep Time:

Ingredients

3 tablespoons olive oil
1 white or yellow onion, chopped
2 cups uncooked brown basmati rice
1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin purÃ©e
6 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
3 bay leaves
Salt and pepper to taste


===================================================================
Directions

In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, 7 to 8 minutes. Add rice and stir to coat with oil. Toast rice, stirring often, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes more. Meanwhile, whisk together pumpkin purée and broth in a large bowl. 

Stir broth mixture and bay leaves into pot, season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and cook, stirring occasionally to keep rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot, until liquid is absorbed and rice is cooked through and creamy, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and serve immediately.
