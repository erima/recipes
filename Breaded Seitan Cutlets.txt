Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	10 thin seitan cutlets
	2 tablespoons arrowroot
	2/3 cup plain soy milk (or rice milk)
	1 1/2 cups cornmeal
	2 tablespoons nutritional yeast

	1/2 teaspoon garlic granules
	1/2 teaspoon onion flakes
	1/4 teaspoon celery seeds
	1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Directions:

	Preheat the oven to broil. Lightly oil a baking sheet and set it aside.

	Dip the cutlets in the soy milk, then roll them in the cornmeal mixture. Press the cornmeal firmly into the cutlets.
	
	Place the breaded cutlets on the baking sheet and place them under the broiler for 5 – 7 minutes, then turn the cutlets over and broil the other side 3 – 5 minutes. 

	Arrange the cutlets on a serving platter and serve with your favorite sauce.
