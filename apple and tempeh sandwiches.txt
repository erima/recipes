Prep Time:

Ingredients:
8 ounces tempeh, halved lengthwise, then crosswise to make 4 squares
1 small apple, Braeburn or Gala apple, cored and thinly sliced
1/2 cup apple juice
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons tamari
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
Black pepper
4 slices whole wheat bread
Honey mustard
4 leaves green leaf lettuce, large leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ÂºF. Arrange tempeh in an 8-inch-square baking dish in a single layer. Scatter apple slices over the top; set aside. 

In a medium bowl, whisk together juice, oil, vinegar, tamari, honey, cumin and pepper, then pour the mixture over the tempeh and apples. Bake until most of the liquid is absorbed, tempeh is golden brown around the edges and apples are soft and caramelized, 40 to 45 minutes. Set aside to let tempeh cool slightly. 

Spread one side of each slice of bread with a bit of honey mustard then top with a piece of lettuce and a piece of tempeh, with the baked apples arranged over the top. Serve.
