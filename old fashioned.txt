Servings/Yield: 1 drink	
Prep Time: 2 minutes

Ingredients: 
	2 ounces of whiskey
	1/2 teaspoon of sugar
	1/2 teaspoon of water
	1 or 2 dashes of Angostura bitters
	A piece of lemon peel
	Ice
	
Directions: 
	"As Don Draper famously demonstrated to Conrad Hilton, the Old Fashioned is historically a built drink, meaning it’s assembled in place and stirred in the drinking vessel (preferably a short, thick bottomed Old Fashioned glass) rather than in a separate mixing glass. That said, I prefer to make mine in a mixing glass and strain it into the serving glass—partly so I can use a generous pile of ice while stirring, partly so I can do a properly vigorous stir without making a mess, and partly because I like to serve the drink with a big block of ice rather than smaller cubes (the Tovolo King Cube tray is a great way to make large ice blocks that fit perfectly into an Old Fashioned glass). The sugar goes in first, followed by a splash of water, which, with the help of a few quick stirs, dissolves the sugar and creates a coarse simple syrup.  Next comes a couple dashes of bitters, the booze, and some ice.  Stir the whole thing well with a fluid motion and then strain it into a glass over ice.  As a final touch, squeeze the lemon peel over the glass to extract some oils and then rub it along the rim of the glass before garnishing the drink with it.  Your Old Fashioned is ready to serve."
