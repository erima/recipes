Servings/Yield: 3 cups
Prep Time: 1â€“1 1/2 hours

Ingredients: 
	1 1/2 cup shredded dried seaweed
	4 cups water
	3 very large cloves garlic, crushed but not peeled.
	1 1/2 tbsp. black peppercorns
	1/2 cup dark Chinese soy sauce
	Extra boiling water as needed
	
Directions: 
	Place the seaweed in a pot and add 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to keep it bubbling along. Cook for 20 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and enough water to make about 6 cups total in the pot. Bring back to a boil, then boil fairly high for at least 1/2 hour. At that point, begin to taste (just a little, though--it's strong). When the stock is reduced by about half, it will be almost too salty to eat, and that means it is ready. Strain through fine mesh or a coffee filter and allow to cool.
