Simple Seitan
=======================

Source: Veganomicon
Servings/Yield: 16 ounces
Prep Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

=======================
Ingredients


1 cup vital wheat gluten flour
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablspoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, pressed or grated on a microplane grater
    
Broth:
8 cups cold water plus 3 vegetable bullion cubes, or 4 cups broth plus 5 cups water
1/4 cup soy sauce

=======================
Directions

Mix together the gluten flour and yeast in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, mix together the veggie broth, soy sauce, olive oil, and garlic. Pour the wet into the dry and stir with a wooden spoon until most of the moisture has been absorbed and the wet ingredients are partially clumped up with the dry ingredients. Use your hands to knead the mixture for about 3 minutes until the dough is elastic. Divide with a knife into three equal pieces and then knead those pieces in your hand just to stretch them out for a bit.
    
Prepare the broth:
Fill a stockpot with the water, boullion cubes, and soy sauce, and add the wheat gluten pieces. Cover and bring to a boil but watch carefully, you don’t want it to boil for very long or the outside of the seitan will be spongy. Try to catch it as soon as it boils and then lower the heat as low as it will go so that it’s at a low simmer.

Partially cover the pot so that the stream can escape and let simmer for an hour, turning the seitan occasionally. Turn off the heat and take the lid off, let sit for 15 minutes.

Notes

Totally different than other seitan recipes. This is a good sausage in meals recipe.
