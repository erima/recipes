Mock BBQ Pork

Source: Vegetarian Resource Group
Servings/Yield: 4 as an appetizer
Prep Time: 90 minutes

Ingredients: 
	8 ounces gluten, cooked according to directions below
	1 Tablespoon toasted sesame oil
	2 Tablespoons lite tamari or soy sauce
	2 Tablespoons water
	1 Tablespoon minced ginger
	1 Tablespoon minced garlic
	1 Tablespoon sweetener
	2 teaspoons five-spice powder
	Vegetable cooking spray

Directions: 
	Form gluten into a cylinder and lightly simmer in water for at least 30 minutes until quite firm. Let cool and cut in small pieces in the Chinese "roll-cut" style. (Cut off one corner, turn the cylinder, cut again and continue.)

	Combine the remaining ingredients to make a marinade. Marinate the gluten pieces for 15 to 30 minutes.

	Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

	Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Drain gluten from marinade. Put on baking sheet and bake for 20 to 30 minutes. If gluten seems to be getting too dry, baste with the marinade.

	Eat as is, use in a stir-fry, or as a filling for mock-pork buns.

Notes: 
	After the first try I’d make the marinade while the other stuff is doing it’s thing. Took a while to mince things.
