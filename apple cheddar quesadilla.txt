Prep Time: 30 minutes

Ingredients:
1 large Gala or Fuji apples, or 2 small
6 tortillas
1 1/2  cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
2  tablespoons butter

Directions:
Thinly slice the apples into 24 1/4-inch-thick slices. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cheese over one half of the tortilla. Place four apple slices, barely overlapping, on top of cheese. Then sprinkle 2 more tablespoons of cheese on top of the apples and fold the tortilla in half. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook three quesadillas until the cheese melts and the tortillas are golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining butter and tortillas.
