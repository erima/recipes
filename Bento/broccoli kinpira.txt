Prepare: 

=====================
Ingredients

2-3 broccoli stalks (resulting in about 2 cups of matchstick stalks). You can add the leaves too.
1 Tbs. dark sesame oil
a pinch of red pepper flakes
1 Tbs. soy sauce
1 tsp. black or white (light brown) sesame seeds

=====================
Directions

If the broccoli stalks are very hard and woody, peel off the skins with a vegetable peeler or knife, and cut off the dried hard end. Slice into thin matchsticks.

Heat up a frying pan or wok with the sesame oil. Add the broccoli stalks and toss around until crisp-tender, about 4 to 5 minutes depending on how skinny the matchsticks are. Add the red pepper flakes and toss some more. Add soy sauce, toss toss. Add the sesame seeds near the end. (You may notice this is identical to the way carrot kinpira is cooked.)
