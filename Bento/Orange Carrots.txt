Source: Just Bento
Servings/Yield: 4 servings
Prep Time: 
Type: Vegetable
Prepare: Frozen or one week in advance

=============================
Ingredients

Juice and peel of 1 medium organic orange
2 medium carrots, sliced or cut into decorative shapes
2 teaspoons sugar
Pinch salt

=============================
Directions

Take a strip of peel from the orange with a sharp knife or vegetable peeler. Make sure there is no white pith on the orange peel, otherwise the carrots will turn bitter.

Place the carrot slices in a saucepan with the orange juice, peel, sugar, and salt. Add just enough water to completely submerge the carrots. Cook over high heat for 5–6 minutes until tender. Remove the peel. Drain the carrots before packing into bento box.

Notes

“Ahead of time note: These carrots can be made up to a week in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Keep the slices submerged in the cooking liquid and well covered. They can be frozen, but will turn a bit soft.”
