Carrot Kinpira
=====================
Source: JustBento.com
Servings/Yield: 
Prep Time: 10 minutes
Type: Vegetable
Prepare: Frozen, or 4 days before

=====================
Ingredients

2 medium carrots
1 Tbs. dark sesame oil
a pinch of red pepper flakes (about 1/8 tsp, or more if you want it spicier)
1 Tbs. soy sauce
1 tsp. sesame seeds

=====================
Directions

Cut the carrots into matchstick size. (Cheat alert - you can use pre-shredded carrots meant for salad if you like, but then lessen the cooking time.)

Heat up a frying pan or wok with the sesame oil. Add the carrots and toss around until crisp-tender, about 4 to 5 minutes depending on how skinny the matchsticks are. Add the red pepper flakes and toss some more. Add soy sauce, toss toss. Add the sesame seeds near the end.

This does theoretically keep in the refrigerator for a couple of days, though around here it never does.
