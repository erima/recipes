Miso Tofu Nuggets with Edamame
=====================
Source: Just Bento
Servings/Yield: 3 servings (9 nuggets)
Prep Time: 
Type: Protein
Prepare: Frozen, or 1 day before

=====================
Ingredients

3 tablespoons finely chopped green onion
2 teaspoons peeled and finely chopped fresh ginger
1 teaspoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons frozen or fresh shelled edamame beans
1 lb (450 grams) firm tofu, drained
3 tablespoons moromi miso, or miso of choice
1/4 teaspoon sea salt (omit if miso is salty)
cornstarch, for coating
vegetable oil for deep frying

=====================
Directions

Sauté the green onion and ginger in the sesame oil for a couple of minutes, then remove from the heat. Boil the edamame in just enough water to cover for about 5 minutes, until tender yet still firm. Alternatively, put the edamame on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high for 30 seconds.

Crumble the tofu in a bowl. Add the sauteéd green onion and ginger, miso, and salt. Mix together thoroughly using your impeccably clean hands. Alternitively, you can mix this in a food processor, pulsing to combine. When everything is combined to a smooth paste, mix in the edamame. 

Divide the tofu mixture into nine portions and form round or oval shaped flattened nuggets. Coat in cornstarch. 

Heat 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the oil in a large frying pan over medium–high heat. The oil is hot enough when a small piece of the cornstarch-coated tofu dropped in the oil turns brown in a few seconds. Fry the nuggets in batches, taking care not to overcrowd the pan, until browned on both sides. Drain well and cool before packing.


=====================
Notes

“These nuggets can be frozen quite successfully. The texture will change a little, but they will still be good. Cold nuggets can be pan-fried in a dry non-stick frying pan over medium heat until crispy on the outside and heated through, or gently poached in dashi stock for a softer texture. They are also good in soup.”

If tofu is moist add more Corn starch or they will fall apart.
