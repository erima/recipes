Ingredients

4 large eggs
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon mirin
½ teaspoon soy sauce
vegetable oil, for frying
parsley, for garnish

=======================
Directions

Mix together all of the ingredients, except for the oil, until the egg yolk and white are amalgamated but not frothy. 

Heat up the frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour in some oil and tilt the pan to spread it around. Take a small wad of paper towel and rub it around the pan to soak up any excess oil. Put the oil soaked wad on a small plate next to the stove. 

Use cooking chopsticks or a fork to draw a little of the egg mixture along the bottom of the pan. If the egg cooks immediately, the pan is hot enough and ready to go. If the egg browns too fast, cool the pan down by putting the bottom on a moistened kitchen towel and lower the heat a little. 

Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan. Tilt the pan to spread it around the bottom. Pierce any large bubbles that form with the chopsticks or fork. 

As soon as the egg starts to set, start rolling it to one side of the pan. Flip one end over with the chopsticks or fork and keep flipping until you have a skinny roll. If you can’t roll the egg you can just push it along to one side until you have a skinny little omelette. 

Leaving the first roll at one side of the pan, rub the oil-soaked wad of paper towel firmly along the bottom of the pan. This adds just enough lubrication while also cleaning up any stray bits of egg. 

Add a little more of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan around to spread it. Lift the first roll up a little so that the uncooked egg runs beneath it.

Puncture any large air bubbles that form, as before. As soon as this layer starts to set on top, roll it around the cooked egg roll to the opposite side of the pan. As before, if the egg is browning too fast, place the pan on a moistened towel for a few seconds. Repeat the preceding three steps until the egg mixture is all used up. The thinner the layers, the more delicately textured the tamagoyaki will be. Try to do a minimum of 4–5 layers. 

When the tamagoyaki is done, turn the seam-side down into the pan and press briefly to seal it. Flip the egg out onto a sushi mat or paper towel. 

Roll the sushi mat or paper towel around the tamagoyaki, forming a rectangular shape. Leave it to cool. 

Cut into even slices before packing. Garnish with the parsley.

Don’t despair if your tamagoyaki doesn’t quite look perfect. It will still taste great!

2 tablespoons finely chopped green onion

Nori Tamagoyaki

1 sheet nori seaweed, 7 x 8 inches, ripped or cut into fairly large pieces

Gently lay down a layer of nori on top of each egg layer as it cooks. The cut side of this tamagoyaki is quite striking.

½ tablespoon furikake

Add your favorite furikake to the egg mixture. Cook as for the basic tamagoyaki.


Parmesan Cheese and Parsley tamagoyake

1 tablespoon parmesan cheese, grated
