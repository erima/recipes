=============================
Source: Just Bento
Servings/Yield: 1
Prep Time: 
Type: Vegetable
Prepare: Same day

=============================
Ingredients

2 oz (60g) mizuna greens washed and trimmed
Juice from 1 teaspoon peeled and grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons soy sauce
Pinch bonito flakes

=============================
Directions

Bring a pan of water to a boil (using an electric kettle to boil the water speeds things up a lot). Put the mizuna in the pan and boil for a minute. Drain, and run cold water into the pan to cool the cooked mizuna rapidly. Drain again, and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.

If necessary, cut into shorter lengths that fit your bento divider cup. Add the ginger juice and soy sauce and mix well. Sprinkle with bonito flakes.

Try blanched arugula for an interesting alternative.
