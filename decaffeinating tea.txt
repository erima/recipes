For the tea lover who is sensitive to caffeine at certain times, or for those who want to moderate their caffeine intake, there is a simple method for partially decaffeinating just about any tea. The procedure is easy and fairly effective. Because caffeine is so easily dissolved in water, about 85 percent of the caffeine in a cup produced by traditional steeping methods will dissolve in the brewing water within 45 to 60 seconds of steeping. You can take advantage of this to significantly lower the caffeine content in your cup by using the following procedure.

Measure tea as you usually do into your favorite pot.

1. Pour the hot water you would normally prepare for steeping over the measured tea, and set your timer for one minute.

2. When the minute has expired, pour off the liquid and discard.

3. Heat fresh water to the appropriate temperature for the tea at hand, pour it over the wet leaves left over from step three and allow the tea to steep for the usual time.

4. Pour the resulting second infusion into your cup and enjoy.

This simple process will yield teas with 2.5 to 10 milligrams of caffeine per cup, depending on the tea and the brewing parameters. However, like most other decaffeinated teas, there will be some loss of flavor and aroma.
