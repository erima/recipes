Roasted Garlic

Take one or more whole, unpeeled, and unseparated bulbs of garlic. With a heavy, sharp knife, slice off approximately 1/2 inch of the entire top of the bulb, exposing the insides of the garlic cloves. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon of olive oil onto the top of the bulb, making sure the cut cloves are covered with oil and some oil sneaks into the space and between the cloves. Wrap tightly in foil and bake at 375ÂºF for 20 to 30 minutes, until the cloves are very soft and turned a deep golden color. For slightly caramelized cloves, unwrap the tops of the bulbs and let them roast for 8 to 10 additional minutes.

Blah blah blah, you can cook them in the oven, whenever it is on, instead of wasting gas/electric.

Keeps for 1 week in refrigerator.
