Servings/Yield: 4 small or 2 large servings
Prep Time: 

Ingredients: 
	Basic Instant Gluten

	Broth:
		2 cups water
		1/4 cup tamari
		2 teaspoons vegan Worcestershire sauce
		1 teaspoon liquid smoke
		2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
		1 teaspoon onion powder
		1 teaspoon garlic powder
		1 teaspoon salt
		1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
		1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
		1/2 teaspoon dried sage

Directions: 
	In a large saucepan, bring all of the broth ingredients to a boil. Slice Basic Instant Gluten into steaks, chunks or strips and drop carefully into broth. Reduce heat and cover with lid. Let simmer for 50-60 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until broth has reduced completely. 

	Use "ham" immediately in your dish of choice or store in the refrigerator (for up to 6 days) or the freezer (for up to 6 months). For a chewier texture, once you've boiled the "ham", bake it at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a lightly oiled baking dish for 30 minutes. 

Notes: 
	When making 2x, 3x, 4x batches remember it takes that it also multiplies the cooking time thusly.
